### Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting techniques and it’s based on the “divide and conquer” paradigm.

- In merge sort, the problem is divided into two subproblems in every iteration.
- Hence efficiency is increased drastically.
- It follows the divide and conquer approach
    1. Divide break the problem into 2 subproblem which continues until the problem set is left with one element only
    2. Conquer basically merges the 2 sorted arrays into the original array
